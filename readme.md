* How to help :

- look at the file "uploaded" to see which video IDs have been uploaded to video hosting services
- White markers on the map indicate videos remaining to be uploaded. Their IDs are in "needed.txt"
- If you upload any of those videos, feel free to post a list of youtube URLs, and I'll add them to the map
- Note : youtube caps daily uploads, limiting the number of videos I can put up per day
